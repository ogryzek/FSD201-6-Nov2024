# TECH FSD201-6 Backend Development - Part 1  

## Week 1 End of Week Exercises

Create a web-based game. It can be as elaborate as you would like or as simple as a text based interaction with some form of a start, a choice that the player makes, and an end.  
  
Try to only use modules that we have discussed this week and/or that are part of the Node standard library. Modules that you develop yourself are also fine.
